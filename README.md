# Getting Started
## Installation
1. Install Libraries: `pip install aiogram`
2. Replace API Keys: Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys for `API_TOKEN` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`

Great! Try to run the bot. Remember to keep your API keys secure and do not share them publicly.

## Customization
- To change the /start message of the bot, change the WELCOME_MESSAGE variable and replace its value with the message you want to insert.
- To change the message when trying to access the API, change the `"⚠️ Error accessing the API"` text on line 26.
- To change the message in case of an incorrect response from the API, change the `"❌ Couldn't process the response"` text on line 32.
